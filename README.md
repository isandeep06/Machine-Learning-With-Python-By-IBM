## 📊 Key Learnings & Insights

### 🔹 Machine Learning Concepts
- ML is a subset of AI enabling systems to **learn from data** and **make decisions** without explicit programming.  
- Includes **supervised learning** (labeled data), **unsupervised learning** (unlabeled data), and **reinforcement learning** (reward-based).

### 🔹 Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- Importance of handling missing values, scaling, encoding, and feature selection.  
- Use of `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` for clean, repeatable workflows.

### 🔹 Model Evaluation
- Avoid overfitting via **cross-validation** and **regularization**.  
- Evaluate performance using metrics tailored to the problem type.  
- Understand trade-offs: **bias vs variance**, **accuracy vs interpretability**.

### 🔹 Project Insights
- **Regression** → Predict continuous variables like taxi tips or housing prices.  
- **Classification** → Identify patterns in data such as survival prediction or rainfall detection.  
- **Clustering & PCA** → Discover natural patterns and simplify high-dimensional data.  
- **End-to-End Pipelines** → Combine preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation for reproducible results.
