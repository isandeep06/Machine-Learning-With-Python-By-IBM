## 🧩 Overview

This repository includes my **projects** and **comprehensive notes** from **Module 4: Unsupervised Learning** of the *Machine Learning with Python* course by IBM.  
This module explores how algorithms can uncover patterns in unlabeled data through clustering and dimensionality reduction.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how **unsupervised learning** identifies patterns in unlabeled datasets  
- Apply **K-Means clustering** for customer segmentation  
- Compare **DBSCAN** and **HDBSCAN** for density-based clustering  
- Perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality  
- Visualize high-dimensional data using **t-SNE** and **UMAP**  
- Combine clustering and dimensionality reduction for feature engineering and analysis
