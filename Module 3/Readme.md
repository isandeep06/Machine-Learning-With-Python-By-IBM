## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains my **projects** and **comprehensive notes** from **Module 3: Classification & Decision Trees** of the [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) course by IBM.  
In this module, I implemented multiple **supervised learning algorithms** and evaluated their performance using metrics like accuracy, MSE, and ROC-AUC.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how **classification models** predict categorical outcomes  
- Implement **Decision Trees** for classification and regression tasks  
- Apply **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for fraud detection  
- Use **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for customer segmentation  
- Build and evaluate **Regression Trees** for continuous prediction  
- Train and compare **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** ensemble models  
- Explore **bias–variance tradeoff** and learn how ensemble models mitigate it
