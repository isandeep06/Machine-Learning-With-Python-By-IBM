## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains my **notes** and **projects** from **Module 5: Model Evaluation, Validation & Regularization**.  
In this module, I learned how to assess and validate ML models using metrics, cross-validation, regularization techniques, and automated model tuning pipelines (GridSearchCV).

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand key **classification and regression metrics**  
- Evaluate models using **Confusion Matrix**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, **MAE**, **MSE**, **RMSE**, and **R²**  
- Apply **cross-validation** and **GridSearchCV** for model validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Prevent **overfitting** and **data leakage** through proper pipeline structuring  
- Implement **regularization techniques** (Ridge & Lasso) for better generalization  
- Interpret model behavior using **feature importance** and residual analysis

## 📊 Key Learnings & Insights

- **Accuracy isn’t everything:** Precision, Recall, and F1-score provide deeper insights for imbalanced data.  
- **Cross-validation** ensures reliability and reduces variance in model performance.  
- **Random Forests** offer interpretability through feature importance visualization.  
- **Regularization** prevents overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.  
- **Pipelines** streamline preprocessing and prevent data leakage.  
- **GridSearchCV** optimizes hyperparameters across full workflows automatically.  
- **Data leakage** is the most common but preventable modeling error.
